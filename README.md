# BLU04 - Advanced data wrangling

## What is in this BLU? 
This is the first BLU in the Data Wrangling specialization.
In this specialization you'll learn how to get data from multiple data sources and how to transform raw data into clean enough data so that you can begin your data science workflow.

In this BLU, we'll start by learning some Jupyter notebooks magics, that can be very useful.
Then, we'll learn about file formats and how to read them efficiently into pandas DataFrames.
Finally, we'll practice some data cleaning, using string methods and other tools.
